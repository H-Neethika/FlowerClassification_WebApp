# Flower Classification Web App

This project implements a web application for classifying flowers using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN model is trained on the [Flower Photos dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/tf_flowers) from TensorFlow's example datasets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Gradio

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/H-Neethika/FlowerClassification_WebApp.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd FlowerClassification_WebApp
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:



## Usage

1. Run all the code:
2. Open your web browser and go to link that will be provided by the gradio to access the application.
3. Upload an image of a flower for classification which should be in the type of sunflowers, dandelion , rose , tulips, daisy .
